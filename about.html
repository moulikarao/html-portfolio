<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Moulika Vangapandu, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Mahindra University with a strong interest in Data Science and Analytics.
   I enjoy solving real-world problems using data and have hands-on experience with machine learning, Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. 
   My academic projects — including traffic volume prediction and Named Entity Recognition for Telugu —
  reflect my ability to apply analytical techniques to diverse domains.</p>

<p>I value honesty, kindness, and good conversations. 
  I believe that growth comes from asking questions, trying (and failing), and always staying open to change.
   If there's one thing that defines me, it’s my desire to keep learning — not just to build a career, 
   but to understand life better.</p>
